  questText: Young Alchemist! I bid thee to concoct a potion for the admirable Gwendolyn
    Windlesham. Known as The Witching Woman, Gwednolyn is renowned amongst peasants
    and nobles alike - there is no tincture or medicine she cannot create. However,
    as her age increases, her <color=#FF6800>dexterity</color> and <color=#FF6800>intelligence</color>
    begin to fade. She requests a reviving potion to assist in her daily duties.
    Do not tarry!
